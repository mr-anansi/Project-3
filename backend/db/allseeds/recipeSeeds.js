    method: ['First, make the pizza base', 'Tip the flour onto your work service and make a well in the centre. Dissolve your yeast in the water and pour into the middle of the well a little at a time whilst using your hands to bring the walls of the flour in so that the water begins to thicken. Once you’ve reached the consistency of custard, add the salt and bring in the rest of the flour until it comes together as a dough. Knead for 10–15 minutes.', 'Cover and leave to rest for 10 minutes before kneading again quickly for 10 seconds (this helps to develop the flavour and the gluten).', 'Divide the dough into 200g balls and leave to rest overnight or for at least 8 hours (24 hours is optimal, 48 hours maximum) in a sealed container or a deep baking dish sprinkled with flour and covered in cling film. Remember to leave space for each of your dough balls because, as the gluten relaxes, they will spread out to take up twice the diameter that they do initially.', ' Scrape a dough ball out of its container using a spatula and as much flour as you need to ensure it doesn’t stick. The rounder the dough ball comes out, the rounder the final pizza base.', 'Put the dough ball onto a well-floured surface (honestly, if you are going to get serious about pizza making, get used to having flour play a large part in your life).', 'Using your fingertips, press out the dough ball firmly, starting at the centre and working out to the edge. Ensure you leave a centimetre around the rim of the pizza untouched.', 'Turn the dough ball over and repeat the pressing out process on the other side.', 'Using the palm of your hand, do one firm push in the centre of the dough ball to ensure the thickness of the base is consistent (not counting the raised edges).', 'Take the newly flattened dough ball on the back of your hands, ensuring the weight is on your knuckles and that your fingertips and nails are not going to poke a hole in the dough.', 'Using the back of your hands, stretch the dough out as far as you can without tearing it (now there’s a challenge). Turn the dough through 90 degrees and repeat this stretching. Do this a few times.', 'You should now have a disc of dough around 10 inches in diameter, consistently thin but with a slightly thicker rim. We are ready to cook.', 'Take the dough balls and press them out flat to make four 10 inch pizza bases using the tips of your fingers.', 'To make the tomato sauce, first crush the tomatoes by hand. This stops the seeds being whizzed up by the blender, which makes the sauce bitter. Add a pinch of salt, then blitz with a hand blender until you have a tomato sauce with a slightly rough texture.', 'Preheat the grill to its absolute highest setting.', 'Lay a pizza base flat in a dry frying pan (preferably non-stick) that has been on a high heat and is screaming hot.', 'Spread a thin layer of sauce with a ladle across the base, leaving a couple of centimetres round the edge for the crust. Add a pinch of Parmesan, basil leaves and a quarter of the mozzarella, in that order. Drizzle with olive oil.', 'Once the base of the pizza has browned (about 1–2 minutes), take the frying pan and place it on the highest shelf, under the grill.', 'Once the crust has taken on some colour (again about 1–2 minutes), the pizza is ready to go. Eat it fast (contrary to popular belief, pizza is not better cold the morning after!).', 'Start making the next one...'],

    author: 'Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer',
    about: 'Ashura is a traditional Turkish dessert also known as Noah’s Ark pudding. The legend goes that, running low on supplies in the ark, Noah boiled together everything they had – dried wheat, beans, fruit, nuts, spices and honey. The whole store cupboard. The result is a very substantial dessert; a meal in itself, really. We use the same ingredients (minus the beans), but instead of boiling them we roast them to make a great alternative to granola. The puffed wheat keeps it light and is easier on your jaw than crunchy oats. ',
    ingredients: ['vegetable oil (rapeseed or sunflower) 85g/95ml', 'honey 110g', 'dark brown soft sugar 110g', 'table salt 1 tsp', 'ground cinnamon 1 tsp', 'ground mahleb seeds ½ tsp', 'ground cardamom ½ tsp', 'puffed wheat 1 packet (160g)', 'pecans 85g, halved', 'sunflower seeds 40g', 'pumpkin seeds 50g', 'sesame seeds 30g', 'almonds 85g, very roughly chopped'],
    method: ['Preheat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5 and line a couple of large flat baking trays with baking parchment. Combine the oil, honey and sugar in a medium pan and set on a high heat. Mix well and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally to avoid it burning on the base. Put the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Once the honey syrup is bubbling, carefully pour it over the dry ingredients in the bowl. Use a large spoon to stir, turning the contents of the bowl over a few times until everything is well coated with the syrup. Transfer the mixture to the baking trays and flatten it out a little so that there is an even layer of cereal.', 'Place in the centre of the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Carefully remove one tray at a time and mix the cereal around to make sure everything is getting roasted and crispy. Return the trays to the oven for an additional 5-6 minutes, then remove and leave the ashura to cool entirely on the trays before breaking into large clusters.', 'Once the cereal is cold, transfer it to an airtight container. This keeps for well over 2 weeks, if you don’t get addicted and eat it all long before then.'],

    about: 'A timeless classic',
    ingredients: ['Eggs', 'Streaky bacon', 'Sausages', 'Black pudding', 'Bread (for frying)', 'Tomatoes', 'Mushrooms'],
    method: ['Cooking “The Full English” is all about preparation, timing and coordination, so get out of bed earlier than you might think. In my kitchen, a best breakfast will be the following: the freshest eggs, smoked streaky bacon, sausages/black pudding (but never both), fried bread, tomatoes and mushrooms. If you like, a slippery handful of three halved lamb’s kidneys, grilled, will add style, and a dish of small, cut-up fried potatoes (remember those that were always served with the old British Rail breakfast of long ago?) may be much appreciated by serious trencher folk, but these are entirely a matter for the cook.', 'Crucially, however, the making of toast, the provision of butter and marmalade and the brewing of coffee is not your job, but that of one’s partner/wife/husband/helpful guest. So, make this quite clear at the outset. And the cook must absolutely not have help at the stove; this is a one-person endeavour, or there will be shouting and pans flung.', 'Always sausages first, so arrange six on a lightly greased baking tray; if you take the black pudding option, cut 6 thick slices from a fatty-flecked British one (do not go down the French boudin noir route, as they are far too sweet, here) and similarly arrange. At the same time, lay out 6 medium-sized dark-gilled flat mushrooms (gills uppermost) and 3 large tomatoes, halved horizontally, onto a similar baking tray.', 'Liberally season both tomatoes and mushrooms and brush with oil. Put to cook in a hot oven (200C/gas mark 6) and do not touch for at least 20 minutes.', 'Be fully aware that these three unconnected ingredients really need to COOK: the sausages need to brown and splutter a bit, the mushrooms will release their juices (they can’t help it) and then soak them back, vaguely browning themselves in the process and, importantly, shrinking to intensely flavoured disks. Furthermore, the tomatoes need to almost collapse to emerge properly cooked; how many inept, supposedly “grilled” tomatoes has one collected from the hotel breakfast buffet to find that they are, weirdly, just warm and uncooked?', 'For me, there is nothing more delicious than a properly cooked tomato releasing its juices into a slice of fried bread, once nudged with the back of a fork. However, that fried bread needs much attention, too, to be ready for such sweet dousings. So, now is the time to quietly allow some fatty streaky bacon to fry (allow three thin slices per person), in batches, using a large frying pan.', 'Allow each batch to quietly crisp, transfer to a flat oven tray lined with a triple fold of kitchen paper, decant the rendered fat onto a large plate and continue. Once all the bacon is cooked transfer the laden tray to the oven (remove the paper), turn off the heat and keep it warm with the sausages, tomatoes and mushrooms which will hopefully, by now, be fully cooked. Whew!', 'For the fried bread, cut six thick slices from a small white loaf and cut off the crusts. Return the frying pan to a low heat and then thickly brush each slice of bread with bacon fat and gently fry on each side until a very special gilded crust is achieved; believe me, this will be the very best fried bread you have ever tasted. Store in the waning oven heat, loosely stacked on top of the tray of bacon. Put six plates to warm through in the oven, too.', 'And, finally, to the eggs. Poached eggs are right out, here, for these perfectly oval ova may only lounge upon buttered toast, all alone – and my chosen last supper, as it happens. So no, here, the eggs must be either simply fried or scrambled; to furnish you with my thoughts and details of how I prefer to assemble the latter could, quite possibly, take the space of another article all its own, so do as you do with your scramblings…', 'As to the fried egg, I only suggest that it is cooked ever so quietly in murmuring best butter, regularly basted with the same, until the deep golden yolk acquires the palest, almost blue-ish opaque membrane. And, finally, have all six hot plates fully garnished with all the other ingredients, before you begin to cook the eggs; a fried egg left to languish is a sad egg, to be sure.'],

The bottom of the omelette should start getting coloured and that’s fine. Turn over and cook the second side for 30-45 seconds on a high heat to finish on the hob, or finish under the grill if you don’t feel comfortable turning over a large round omelette.', 'Repeat the same with the remaining mix to make the second omelette.', 'Serve with generously buttered slices of crusty bread, tomato ketchup and I love my omelettes with a spoon of English mustard too!', 'You could add finely chopped vegetables like asparagus, olives, spinach or artichokes to the omelette if you like: toss the vegetables first and add the egg mixture and cook as above.'],

Vegetarians find this version addictive: one friend of mine has been cooking it every week since I first taught her the recipe some 10 years ago. In Sichuan, they use garlic leaves (suan miao) rather than baby leeks, but as they are hard to find, tender young leeks make a good substitute, as do spring onion greens. This dish is best made with the tenderest tofu that will hold its shape when cut into cubes.',

Pour in the cooking oil and swirl it around. Reduce the heat to medium, add the chilli bean paste and stir-fry until the oil is a rich red colour and smells delicious. Next add the black beans and ground chillies (if using) and stir-fry for a few seconds more until you can smell them too. Then do the same with the ginger and garlic. Take care not to overheat the seasonings; you want a thick, fragrant sauce and the secret of this is to let them sizzle gently, allowing the oil to coax out their flavours and aromas.', 'Remove the tofu from the hot water with a perforated spoon, shaking off excess water, and lay it gently in the wok. Push the tofu tenderly with the back of your ladle or wok scoop to mix it into the sauce without breaking it up.', 'Add the stock or water, white pepper and salt to taste and mix gently, again using the back of the scoop so you don’t damage the tofu.', 'Bring to a boil, then simmer for a few minutes to allow the tofu to absorb the flavours of the seasonings. Add the leek slices (if using) and nudge them into the sauce. When they are just tender, add a little of the flour and water mixture and stir gently as the liquid thickens. Repeat once or twice more, until the sauce clings to the seasonings and tofu (don’t add more than you need). If you are using spring onions rather than leeks, add them now and nudge them gently into the sauce.', 'Pour the tofu into a deep bowl. Sprinkle with the ground roasted Sichuan pepper and serve.'],

Uncover, remove from the heat and set aside to cool totally before stirring in the cheese and coriander.', 'Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.', 'Use the remaining oil to brush the sides and bases of an extra-large 6-hole muffin tin (each hole should be 6cm wide and 4cm deep). Line the bases with circles of baking parchment and place the tin in the fridge. Roll out the pastry 2–3mm thick, cut out 6 circles, 14cm in diameter, and press down into the tin. Trim the edges, reusing the spare pastry to roll out for a second time. Cut out 6 more circles, 8cm in diameter – these will form lids.', 'Fill each pie with about 120g of filling, brush the rims with egg and place the lids on top. Pinch the edges together securely, brush the lids with the remaining egg and prick each pie with a fork in a few places. Allow to rest in the fridge for 10 minutes. Place in the oven and bake for 30–35 minutes, until golden-brown. Remove from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes before serving warm or at room temperature.'],

Place them on the final baking tray and add the chickpeas and cubes of paneer.', 'Put 6 tablespoons of oil into a small bowl with 1⅓ teaspoons of salt, the chilli powder, cumin, garam masala and lemon juice. Mix well, then spoon over the vegetables, adding more to the tomato and paneer tray than the other two. Make sure everything is evenly coated, then put the trays in the oven – with the paneer on the top shelf – and bake for 40 minutes, checking and stirring after 20 minutes.', 'In the meantime, put 3 tablespoons of oil into your casserole or biryani dish over a medium heat.

Check the salt and take off the heat.', 'Next, drain the the rice and place in a deep saucepan. Cover with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a fast simmer and cook for 10 minutes or until the rice is just tender. Drain well, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to one side. Break the egg into a small cup, add a generous pinch of salt and whisk with a fork.', 'Now you are ready to layer your biryani. The aim is to end with a rice layer topped with caramelised onions. First, put half of the paneer, tomato and chickpea mixture into the bottom of the pot. Follow with a quarter of the rice and a quarter of the onion mix. Then add half of the coconut and coriander sauce and half of the beetroot and sweet potatoes, then a further quarter of the rice and onions. Repeat, finishing with a final layer of rice and onions.', 'Cut a square of puff pastry to fit over the top of your pot.

Place in the oven for 25 minutes.', 'Gingerly take out of the oven and place on the table. Cut the pastry away and discard to reveal the steamy biryani.

Mix the flours together in a large bowl with the salt (and the dry or easy-blend yeast if using) and either by hand or with the dough hook attachment of a machine, mix in the liquids until well amalgamated.

Lift the discs up one by one and rotate them around in your fingers, allowing the dough to be pulled downwards by gravity. This will make the pizza thinner and more crisp when cooked.', 'Sprinkle two baking sheets with fine polenta and lay each disc on top carefully. Brush with olive oil then scatter with the sliced raw red onion, the cooked potatoes, the remaining chopped herbs, salt and pepper. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until pale golden.

This meat-free dish provides all the protein you need. Not only is it spicy and filling, it can also be put together in no time.',

    method: ['Put the lentils into a large pan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and leave to cook for 15-20 minutes, or until tender, topping up the water if needed.', 'Meanwhile, make the spice mix. Place a large frying pan, without any oil, over a medium heat and add the cardamom pods, cloves and cumin seeds. After about 30 seconds they should start to give off a toasted, fragrant aroma. Shake the pan gently and cook for another 30 seconds then immediately remove from the heat and grind in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder. Once partially ground, you can remove and discard the papery husks of the cardamom, releasing the black seeds inside. Continue grinding until you have a coarse powder. Add the turmeric, bay leaves and cinnamon stick and set aside.', 'Put the ginger, garlic, whole chillies, onion and salt into a food processor and blitz to a paste.', 'Return the frying pan to the heat and add the oil. When it is hot, add the paste and fry over a medium heat for a few minutes. Then add the spice mix and the tomatoes and cook on a low heat for another 5 minutes or so.', 'When the lentils are tender, strain them to remove any excess liquid (reserving the liquid) and return the lentils to the pan. Add all the aromatic spice mixture and the boiled eggs to the pan and stir well. If the mixture looks too dry add some of the reserved liquid to make a loose sauce.', 'Cook the lentils for another 5 minutes so they become infused with the spice flavours. (Up to this point, everything can be done in advance and reheated when needed.)', 'When you’re ready to serve, sprinkle with the chopped coriander and stir in the yogurt to make a creamy sauce surrounding the lentils and eggs.

Cover the bowl with clingfilm and cook in a microwave on high for 3-4 minutes. Otherwise, simmer them gently in a non-reactive pan just until they’re tender, juicy and piping hot (do not boil). Set aside to cool; once cold, cover and chill in the fridge along with the cubed watermelon flesh (in a separate container) for 2-3 hours, or until completely cold.', 'Once the figs are thoroughly chilled, liquidise them with the watermelon, sugar and lemon juice for 2-3 minutes, long enough for the sugar granules to dissolve. Use a small ladle to push the puree through a fine-mesh sieve or chinois. Save a couple of teaspoons of the pips if you like and add these back to the puree for texture.', 'To make the sorbet: pour the dark red puree into an ice cream machine and churn according to the machine’s instructions, usually about 20-25 minutes, or until frozen and thick and creamy-looking. If you insist on making ice cream without a machine you can freeze the mixture in a big bowl. After 45 minutes, take it out from the freezer and whisk vigorously. Do this twice, and then consecutively with a big metal spoon or spatula every 30 minutes until smooth, frozen and uniform.', 'Transfer the sorbet to a suitable lidded container and top with a piece of waxed paper to limit exposure to air.
