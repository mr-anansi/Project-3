    ingredients: ['1kg ‘00’ flour with a high gluten content', '2g fresh baker’s yeast', '600ml cold water', '30g table salt'],
    method: ['First, make the pizza base', 'Tip the flour onto your work service and make a well in the centre. Dissolve your yeast in the water and pour into the middle of the well a little at a time whilst using your hands to bring the walls of the flour in so that the water begins to thicken. Once you’ve reached the consistency of custard, add the salt and bring in the rest of the flour until it comes together as a dough. Knead for 10–15 minutes.', 'Cover and leave to rest for 10 minutes before kneading again quickly for 10 seconds (this helps to develop the flavour and the gluten).', 'Divide the dough into 200g balls and leave to rest overnight or for at least 8 hours (24 hours is optimal, 48 hours maximum) in a sealed container or a deep baking dish sprinkled with flour and covered in cling film. Remember to leave space for each of your dough balls because, as the gluten relaxes, they will spread out to take up twice the diameter that they do initially.', ' Scrape a dough ball out of its container using a spatula and as much flour as you need to ensure it doesn’t stick. The rounder the dough ball comes out, the rounder the final pizza base.', 'Put the dough ball onto a well-floured surface (honestly, if you are going to get serious about pizza making, get used to having flour play a large part in your life).', 'Using your fingertips, press out the dough ball firmly, starting at the centre and working out to the edge. Ensure you leave a centimetre around the rim of the pizza untouched.', 'Turn the dough ball over and repeat the pressing out process on the other side.', 'Using the palm of your hand, do one firm push in the centre of the dough ball to ensure the thickness of the base is consistent (not counting the raised edges).', 'Take the newly flattened dough ball on the back of your hands, ensuring the weight is on your knuckles and that your fingertips and nails are not going to poke a hole in the dough.', 'Using the back of your hands, stretch the dough out as far as you can without tearing it (now there’s a challenge). Turn the dough through 90 degrees and repeat this stretching. Do this a few times.', 'You should now have a disc of dough around 10 inches in diameter, consistently thin but with a slightly thicker rim. We are ready to cook.', 'Take the dough balls and press them out flat to make four 10 inch pizza bases using the tips of your fingers.', 'To make the tomato sauce, first crush the tomatoes by hand. This stops the seeds being whizzed up by the blender, which makes the sauce bitter. Add a pinch of salt, then blitz with a hand blender until you have a tomato sauce with a slightly rough texture.', 'Preheat the grill to its absolute highest setting.', 'Lay a pizza base flat in a dry frying pan (preferably non-stick) that has been on a high heat and is screaming hot.', 'Spread a thin layer of sauce with a ladle across the base, leaving a couple of centimetres round the edge for the crust. Add a pinch of Parmesan, basil leaves and a quarter of the mozzarella, in that order. Drizzle with olive oil.', 'Once the base of the pizza has browned (about 1–2 minutes), take the frying pan and place it on the highest shelf, under the grill.', 'Once the crust has taken on some colour (again about 1–2 minutes), the pizza is ready to go. Eat it fast (contrary to popular belief, pizza is not better cold the morning after!).', 'Start making the next one...'],

Put on a lined baking sheet as close to the grill as possible and grill for six to eight minutes on each side, until nicely charred at the edges.', 'Puree the sauce until smooth, then, once the chicken is done, return the pureed sauce to the pan on a medium heat. Stir any remaining marinade into the sauce, along with the chillies, sugar, cream and paprika – you can add more of the latter if necessary to give the sauce a deeper colour. Add the chicken, fenugreek and garam masala and cook for about five minutes, then taste for seasoning. Add more salt or sugar or the lemon juice if you like, then serve with chopped coriander.'],

    name: 'Ashura Cereal',
    author: 'Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer',
    about: 'Ashura is a traditional Turkish dessert also known as Noah’s Ark pudding. The legend goes that, running low on supplies in the ark, Noah boiled together everything they had – dried wheat, beans, fruit, nuts, spices and honey. The whole store cupboard. The result is a very substantial dessert; a meal in itself, really. We use the same ingredients (minus the beans), but instead of boiling them we roast them to make a great alternative to granola. The puffed wheat keeps it light and is easier on your jaw than crunchy oats. ',
    ingredients: ['vegetable oil (rapeseed or sunflower) 85g/95ml', 'honey 110g', 'dark brown soft sugar 110g', 'table salt 1 tsp', 'ground cinnamon 1 tsp', 'ground mahleb seeds ½ tsp', 'ground cardamom ½ tsp', 'puffed wheat 1 packet (160g)', 'pecans 85g, halved', 'sunflower seeds 40g', 'pumpkin seeds 50g', 'sesame seeds 30g', 'almonds 85g, very roughly chopped'],
    method: ['Preheat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5 and line a couple of large flat baking trays with baking parchment. Combine the oil, honey and sugar in a medium pan and set on a high heat. Mix well and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally to avoid it burning on the base. Put the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Once the honey syrup is bubbling, carefully pour it over the dry ingredients in the bowl. Use a large spoon to stir, turning the contents of the bowl over a few times until everything is well coated with the syrup. Transfer the mixture to the baking trays and flatten it out a little so that there is an even layer of cereal.', 'Place in the centre of the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Carefully remove one tray at a time and mix the cereal around to make sure everything is getting roasted and crispy. Return the trays to the oven for an additional 5-6 minutes, then remove and leave the ashura to cool entirely on the trays before breaking into large clusters.', 'Once the cereal is cold, transfer it to an airtight container. This keeps for well over 2 weeks, if you don’t get addicted and eat it all long before then.'],

    about: 'A timeless classic',
    ingredients: ['Eggs', 'Streaky bacon', 'Sausages', 'Black pudding', 'Bread (for frying)', 'Tomatoes', 'Mushrooms'],
    method: ['Cooking “The Full English” is all about preparation, timing and coordination, so get out of bed earlier than you might think. In my kitchen, a best breakfast will be the following: the freshest eggs, smoked streaky bacon, sausages/black pudding (but never both), fried bread, tomatoes and mushrooms. If you like, a slippery handful of three halved lamb’s kidneys, grilled, will add style, and a dish of small, cut-up fried potatoes (remember those that were always served with the old British Rail breakfast of long ago?) may be much appreciated by serious trencher folk, but these are entirely a matter for the cook.', 'Crucially, however, the making of toast, the provision of butter and marmalade and the brewing of coffee is not your job, but that of one’s partner/wife/husband/helpful guest. So, make this quite clear at the outset. And the cook must absolutely not have help at the stove; this is a one-person endeavour, or there will be shouting and pans flung.', 'Always sausages first, so arrange six on a lightly greased baking tray; if you take the black pudding option, cut 6 thick slices from a fatty-flecked British one (do not go down the French boudin noir route, as they are far too sweet, here) and similarly arrange. At the same time, lay out 6 medium-sized dark-gilled flat mushrooms (gills uppermost) and 3 large tomatoes, halved horizontally, onto a similar baking tray.', 'Liberally season both tomatoes and mushrooms and brush with oil. Put to cook in a hot oven (200C/gas mark 6) and do not touch for at least 20 minutes.', 'Be fully aware that these three unconnected ingredients really need to COOK: the sausages need to brown and splutter a bit, the mushrooms will release their juices (they can’t help it) and then soak them back, vaguely browning themselves in the process and, importantly, shrinking to intensely flavoured disks. Furthermore, the tomatoes need to almost collapse to emerge properly cooked; how many inept, supposedly “grilled” tomatoes has one collected from the hotel breakfast buffet to find that they are, weirdly, just warm and uncooked?', 'For me, there is nothing more delicious than a properly cooked tomato releasing its juices into a slice of fried bread, once nudged with the back of a fork. However, that fried bread needs much attention, too, to be ready for such sweet dousings. So, now is the time to quietly allow some fatty streaky bacon to fry (allow three thin slices per person), in batches, using a large frying pan.', 'Allow each batch to quietly crisp, transfer to a flat oven tray lined with a triple fold of kitchen paper, decant the rendered fat onto a large plate and continue. Once all the bacon is cooked transfer the laden tray to the oven (remove the paper), turn off the heat and keep it warm with the sausages, tomatoes and mushrooms which will hopefully, by now, be fully cooked. Whew!', 'For the fried bread, cut six thick slices from a small white loaf and cut off the crusts. Return the frying pan to a low heat and then thickly brush each slice of bread with bacon fat and gently fry on each side until a very special gilded crust is achieved; believe me, this will be the very best fried bread you have ever tasted. Store in the waning oven heat, loosely stacked on top of the tray of bacon. Put six plates to warm through in the oven, too.', 'And, finally, to the eggs. Poached eggs are right out, here, for these perfectly oval ova may only lounge upon buttered toast, all alone – and my chosen last supper, as it happens. So no, here, the eggs must be either simply fried or scrambled; to furnish you with my thoughts and details of how I prefer to assemble the latter could, quite possibly, take the space of another article all its own, so do as you do with your scramblings…', 'As to the fried egg, I only suggest that it is cooked ever so quietly in murmuring best butter, regularly basted with the same, until the deep golden yolk acquires the palest, almost blue-ish opaque membrane. And, finally, have all six hot plates fully garnished with all the other ingredients, before you begin to cook the eggs; a fried egg left to languish is a sad egg, to be sure.'],

Use colourful rainbow chard if you can find it, and you could also use a variety of different mushrooms. Serve warm or at room temperature.',
    ingredients: ['olive oil 1 tbsp', 'red onion 1, thinly sliced', 'garlic 2 cloves, thinly sliced', 'ginger 2 tbsp, finely chopped or grated', 'walnuts 100g, coarsely chopped', 'freekeh 200g, rinsed and drained', 'cider vinegar 1 tbsp', 'butter 60g', 'medium-thickness leek ¾, thinly sliced', 'portabello mushrooms 4, sliced, or a variety of types', 'rainbow or swiss chard 300g', 'tahini 2 tbsp', 'lemon juice 1 tbsp', 'mascarpone 200g, at room temperature', 'flat-leaf parsley 1 small bunch, coarsely chopped (including stalks)'],

Add the walnuts and cook for 30 seconds, coating them in the oil, then add the freekeh and 500ml of water. Bring to the boil, then cover the pan and lower the heat to a simmer and cook until it is almost cooked but still a little al dente, about 10-12 minutes. Turn off the heat, mix in the vinegar and 1 teaspoon of salt, and leave to cool with the lid on.', 'While the freekeh is cooking, place a medium pan on a medium heat. Add the butter and cook until it turns nut brown. Add the leek and cook until it wilts, stirring as it cooks. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until they, too, begin to collapse. Add salt to taste.', 'Next, prepare the chard. Cut the leaves from the stalks and wash both the leaves and stalks to remove any grit. Thinly slice the stalks crossways and put to one side. Roll up the leaves and shred them. Add the stalks to the mushroom mix and cook for 2 minutes, stirring from time to time. Stir in the leaves and taste for seasoning. Cover the pan and turn off the heat.', 'Mix the tahini and lemon juice together to a paste, then mix in the mascarpone until combined.', 'To serve, place the freekeh on your plates and spoon the mushroom and chard mixture on top.

    method: ['To make the garlic oil and crumb, puree the garlic with 100ml oil in a food processor. In a saucepan heat the remaining 200ml oil to 160C, then add the garlic puree. This will lower the heat. Fry the garlic at 140C till lightly golden and crispy. It is best if you occasionally stir the oil with a whisk. Strain the oil, reserving it, and spread out the garlic crumb over kitchen roll to remove any excess fat and sprinkle some sea salt over it.

Put the washed rice in the pot and top it with water until it comes up to 400g in total. Once you have the measurement right, cover the pot with lid and cook it on minimum heat until all the water has evaporated. Try the top layer of rice at this stage, it should be completely soft; if it’s not, put the lid back on and cook a few minutes further. Once the rice is cooked, turn off the heat, stir the rice gently with a spoon to get rid of some of the steam and put the lid back on for it to rest a bit further, about 15 minutes.', 'Meanwhile, make the mushrooms.

You need to stir the mushrooms from time to time while the liquid is reducing. Keep an eye on it to prevent the mushrooms from burning.', 'To serve, put some rice in 2 bowls and cover the rice with the cooked mushrooms. Place an egg yolk in the middle of the mushrooms, add finely chopped coriander and sprinkle with garlic crumb around the egg yolk. Finally, add a pinch of salt on top of the yolk and serve.'],

Vegetarians find this version addictive: one friend of mine has been cooking it every week since I first taught her the recipe some 10 years ago. In Sichuan, they use garlic leaves (suan miao) rather than baby leeks, but as they are hard to find, tender young leeks make a good substitute, as do spring onion greens. This dish is best made with the tenderest tofu that will hold its shape when cut into cubes.',
    ingredients: ['plain white tofu, 500-600g', 'salt', 'baby leeks or spring onions 4, green parts only', 'cooking oil 4 tbsp', 'Sichuan chilli bean paste 2½ tbsp', 'fermented black beans 1 tbsp, rinsed and drained', 'ground red chillies 2 tsp (optional)', 'ginger 1 tbsp, finely chopped', 'garlic 1 tbsp, finely chopped', 'stock or water 100ml', 'ground white pepper ¼ tsp', 'potato flour 2 tsp, mixed with 2 tbsp cold water', 'roasted Sichuan pepper ¼-½ tsp, ground'],
    method: ['Cut the tofu into 2cm cubes and leave to steep in very hot, lightly salted water while you prepare the other ingredients (do not allow the water to boil or the tofu will become porous and less tender).', 'Slice the baby leeks or spring onion greens at a steep angle into thin “horse ears”.', 'Heat a wok over a high flame. Pour in the cooking oil and swirl it around. Reduce the heat to medium, add the chilli bean paste and stir-fry until the oil is a rich red colour and smells delicious. Next add the black beans and ground chillies (if using) and stir-fry for a few seconds more until you can smell them too. Then do the same with the ginger and garlic. Take care not to overheat the seasonings; you want a thick, fragrant sauce and the secret of this is to let them sizzle gently, allowing the oil to coax out their flavours and aromas.', 'Remove the tofu from the hot water with a perforated spoon, shaking off excess water, and lay it gently in the wok. Push the tofu tenderly with the back of your ladle or wok scoop to mix it into the sauce without breaking it up.', 'Add the stock or water, white pepper and salt to taste and mix gently, again using the back of the scoop so you don’t damage the tofu.', 'Bring to a boil, then simmer for a few minutes to allow the tofu to absorb the flavours of the seasonings. Add the leek slices (if using) and nudge them into the sauce. When they are just tender, add a little of the flour and water mixture and stir gently as the liquid thickens. Repeat once or twice more, until the sauce clings to the seasonings and tofu (don’t add more than you need). If you are using spring onions rather than leeks, add them now and nudge them gently into the sauce.', 'Pour the tofu into a deep bowl. Sprinkle with the ground roasted Sichuan pepper and serve.'],

    about: 'Yakhni means “meat stock/broth”. Some of the spices and the name “yakhni” are Kashmiri but this dish is not made in Kashmir but in modern-day Uttar Pradesh – one of the theories about the origin of this pulau was that it was made in the palace of the ruler of Oudh (modern-day Lucknow) by Kashmiri cooks in the middle of the 19th century. This is a wonderful one pot dish to make – if you omit the fresh green chillies or add a couple of mild chillies, it is great for the entire family as children can also eat this easily. Use bone in chicken thighs for preparing the stock in which to cook the rice – don’t try and make it with boneless chicken or breast, as the stock will have absolutely no flavour. The essence of this dish is the yakhni – the delicate flavour of the stock which is absorbed by the rice. The pale colour of the pulao is very deceptive; it is packed with flavour and spices.',
    ingredients: ['basmati rice 400g', 'salt', 'onions 2 medium, finely sliced', 'oil 3 tbsp', 'skinless chicken thighs 1kg, bone in, cut in half – ask your butcher to do this for you if you don’t have a cleaver', 'fresh green chillies 2 or 3 (optional)', 'mint a sprig, for garnish (optional)', 'garlic 6 cloves, cut in half', 'fresh ginger 5cm, cut into thick slices', 'green cardamom 6 pods', 'cloves, 6', 'cinnamon stick 2 pieces, 2½cm each', 'black cardamom 1 pod', 'bay leaves 3 or 4', 'fennel seeds 2 heaped tbsp', 'whole coriander seeds 2 level tsp'],
    method: ['Start by washing the basmati rice, then leave it covered in water to soak with half a teaspoon of salt. Place all the spice bag ingredients in an infuser bag or square of muslin or other clean coth and tie up tightly with kitchen string.', 'Next, fry the sliced onions in 3 tablespoons of oil till they are caramelised and golden brown. Remove the onions from the oil to prevent them from burning and spread them on a plate. Keep the heat on medium high and add the chicken to the pan and seal it in the hot oil. Return half the onions to the pan together with the spice bag (the bag should be tied securely so it does not open in the cooking process). The other half of the browned onions will be used as a garnish at the end. Add enough water to cover the chicken and season with salt (just as a rough guide, I usually use 2¼ teaspoons of salt). Once the water is boiling, lower the heat and cover the pan with a lid, and leave it to cook for 20 minutes. Half way through, check the chicken to make sure it is not falling apart!', 'After the chicken is cooked, remove the chicken gently with a slotted spoon and put it on a plate, in a single layer as much as possible to prevent the meat from coming off the bone. You will need approximately 960ml of yakhni for the 400g of rice. Reduce the stock or add some water if required to make it 960ml. My grandmother would squeeze the spice bag at this stage to get the last bit of flavour out of the spices. You can try that too, as long as you can do it without bursting the bag! You can remove the spice bag now. It has done its job.', 'Return the 960ml yakhni back to the pan. After that, take the rice out of the water it was soaking in and add to the stock, together with the chicken and green chillies if you are adding any.', 'Put the stock with the rice and chicken on medium-high flame. Once the stock is boiling, lower the flame, cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer. Check the rice often to see when the stock has been absorbed. The rice should be cooked but al dente (if that makes sense!).', 'At this point, remove the pan from direct heat and put the flame on a low setting and put the pan on an iron plate – a flat pan or tawa, or the closest thing you have to a tawa in your kitchen. The aim is for the heat to be diffused. If you do not have anything appropriate you could put the rice pot in a low oven for 10 minutes. Once you remove the rice from the heat source cover the top with a kitchen towel and leave the rice undisturbed for 10 minutes. Then serve garnished with the caramelised brown onions and sprig of mint.'],

Lentils vary in size, variety and, it has to be said, age, and take vastly different times to approach tenderness.', 'I prefer to salt them towards the end of the cooking time, as occasionally an early salting seems to toughen them, as it can other dried pulses.', 'The twist: This recipe can be adapted to include thin strips of belly pork instead of sausages.', 'Cut the pork into pencil-thick strips, cook briefly to crisp the fat, then continue as above.'],

It is cooked in olive oil and flavoured with saffron, garlic and flat-leaf parsley.

Quarter the tomatoes and blitz them into passata. Pour it into the pan. Simmer for a few minutes until juicy but not too wet. Mix in the drained pasta and turn off the heat.
